I created test automation dashboard using NodeJS, ExpressJS, JavaScript and HTML

For this I had to create a SQL Server test database and log all test execution details, results, runtimes, durations, error messages. 

It can be deployed to Heroku or Openshift and can be used internally for test automation results analysis

This dashboard is very useful in communicating importance of test automation and understanding of test executions, reports to management and other teams

I will add more details in the future
