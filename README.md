I created test automation dashboard using NodeJS, ExpressJS, JavaScript and HTML and deployed it to openshift. It is available via web url internally through company. For this I had to create a SQL Server test database and log all test execution details, results, runtimes, durations, error messages. This dashboard is very useful in communicating importance of test automation and understanding of test executions, reports to management and other teams.
